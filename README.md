# Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis


### Overview

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests taken by high school students that are traditionally used by colleges and universities in their selection of new students.
There has been controversy over whether these tests are fair and accurate predictors of student success, and some universities have recently dropped requirements for applicants to participate in them.
The College Board and ACT, Inc. have been campaigning to maintain their role in the college  admissions process.



### Problem Statement

Iâ€™ll be taking the perspective of a state board of education, we are considering partnering with the SAT or ACT to increase participation in college entrance exams.  The purpose of this presentation is to determine whether to make one of these exams mandatory for high school graduation, and, if so, should it be the SAT or ACT

### Conclusion

I recommend the state partner with the College Board to make the SAT mandatory for all high school graduates. Having a contract to administer the SAT will make college-entrance testing more accessible for all students, and will eliminate the need for the state to administer its own benchmark tests. While the ACT has had a higher number of states mandating the ACT in recent years, recent trends have shown a shift towards the SAT, and we should choose the same.  Since its redesign in 2016, the SAT is more closely aligned with state education benchmarks and is able to provide more resources for testing and preparation. Also, while participation in these tests did not show to be a strong predictor of with future success, SAT participation did show a slight correlation with attainment of higher education.  Along with forming a partnership with the College Board, it is recommended that the state work with local school districts to provide resources and testing days for students.  It is also recommended that further research be conducted to follow long-term trends between college-entrance exam participation and student success.
